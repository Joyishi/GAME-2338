# Quality Lab

## Game One: Super Smash Bros. Ultimate

The game looks very prestine and like it had a lot of quality control to make it as good-looking to all audiences as possible.
Sakurai has made sure that they were able to bring in all the characters and stages from the previous Smash games even though it took
a considerable amount of effort on his behalf and probably a lot of money on Nintendo's behalf. Because of this, it really does
give that "ultimate" feel to it. The story mode, while lackluster, is still a nice addition to what is already a great game.
There are many different control options for many different users of the game. It supports Gamecube, Pro Controller, Joycon, and even
3rd party controllers so that anyone who's comfortable with any controller type can join in on the fun. 
The game is available in cartridge or downloadable from the store so that those who want to beat traffic can still play the game without
having to go out.

## Game Two: Pokemon Sword/Shield

Many people have hated the graphics of the game and it did not look right at all during shows or demos. Once people realized that it was
supposed to have an english renaissance feel to the art style then it all started to make sense, somewhat. A lot of people still do not
agree with the graphics and do not appreciate the Pokemon Company for making the very first console game look "bad". I, on the other hand,
really enjoy the simplistic feel and cartoony/anime graphics the game has to offer. 
The game plays like all other Pokemon games but also adds in new items to make grinding for late game and the competitive scene much easier
to achieve. New mechanics also help the player connect more with their desired Pokemon through the use of Pokemon Camp. 
All in all, the game is by far the best Pokemon game I've ever played, though many others would disagree completely. 

## Game Three: Super Mario Odyssey. 

For being a launce title for the Nintendo Switch Super Mario Odyssey is definetly a console seller. It looked amazing for a Mario game and
had a charm that not many other games can achieve. The designs of the enemies and even giving them clothing based on the part of the world
that Mario visited was genius and very cute. 
The new mechanics were also a welcome change with the introduction of Cappy. All of the old features from the previous games were included
like rolling, dashing, sliding, and of course jumping. But Cappy changed them up with the additional hat throw that allowed Mario to reach
even higher or futher than he ever could before. 
Mario is one of the most recognizable video game icons in the world and his controls are still very simple just like the old days. Anyone
can grab the controller and not be overwhelmed with how much there is to do, especially if they've never played the game before. It allows
for a lot of creativity and freedom with discovery.
