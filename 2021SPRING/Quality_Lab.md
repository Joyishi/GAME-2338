# Quality Lab

Game: Scribbl.io - Browser / Mobile
  - A really fun time waster that allows for quick and funny schenanigans among friends. 
  
Game: Super Smash Bros. Ultimate - Switch
  - Everyone knows it, most people love it, some people hate it. But I'm a neutral party. I like the game when it's played for fun but I'm not very fond of the competitive scene. However that doesn't stop me from thinking that the game is a very high quality game and deserving of it's praises and awards. 
  
Game: Among Us - PC / Mobile / Switch
  - Has a lot of different qualities that make it stand out among the rest. Lots of replayability and functions work as intended. Also available on multiple different platforms so it's very portable. I love how fast the games are as it makes it very fun even when you lose.
